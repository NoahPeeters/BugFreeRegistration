# The Bug-Free Signup Form

This project is a simple signup form which opens a second page with some client-side validation. However, there is one bug in the validation code.
The website checks if the entered age is more than 16. This does not match the description on the root page.

## Background

This page was created as a test page for a university project.
The goal is to have a website with a simple and reproducable bug to test how easy it is to create a bug ticket with GitLab Issues.
